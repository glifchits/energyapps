==========

This is my submission to the [GreenButton energy apps for Ontario contest](http://energyappsontario.challengepost.com).
Its still a work in progress.

I'm publicly releasing this code before the contest end date to demonstrate a significant project I'm working on while I
talk to recruiters for a fall 2014 co-op term.

Disclaimer
----------

I haven't used best practices, mostly because I was rushed to make this and also because this is a larger scale project
than I'm used to.

While the contest is in progress, this code is licensed under the 
[Microsoft Reference Source License](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/referencesourcelicense.aspx).
You may not redistribute or modify this code. This is only because I'm paranoid that someone will claim this work
for their own. I hope to release this under a liberal license after the contest.
